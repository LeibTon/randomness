# Randomness

### Just a random experiment on randomness

This project is based on Autoregressive models trying to predict your randomness in generating a sequence of 0's and 1's.(whole thing based on a Neuromatch tutorial.)  
[Let's Explore Randomness](https://prakashaditya369.github.io/randomness)

## Source Code:

The raw ReactJS code for the algorithm is in [SourceCode](/SourceCode) folder. It has normal React Framework like struture.  

The backend of the code is developed using Flask framework. It can be accessed [here](https://github.com/prakashaditya369/flaskbackend/blob/master/random_experiment.py)

Makes use of chart.js to display beautiful visualisations.

Deployed on [onrender](onrender.com)

## Additional Scripts:

- [compile.sh](/compile.sh): Shell Script to build the react code. Copy the compiled code into the folder to be pushed and source code in SourceCode folder. Then pushes the entire code to Github.

##### Thanks.
